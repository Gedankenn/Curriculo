## 🧠 About Me

Passionate about embedded systems, Linux, and the fusion between hardware and software. I enjoy creating efficient and robust real-time systems, and I'm always diving deep into technologies that power the real world — from gas stations to trains. A father, gamer, and problem-solver at heart.
